This tool allows to build iconography showing what Open Web Platform features are supported in current mobile browsers, as illustrated in [Standards for Web Applications on Mobile: February 2012 current state and roadmap](http://www.w3.org/2012/02/mobile-web-app-state/).

It does so by aggregating data from [CanIUse](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/), [MobileHTML5](http://mobilehtml5.org) and combining it with locally maintained data.

This project is funded by the European Union through the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2010-2012) under grant agreement nÂ°257800 - [Mobile Web Applications](http://mobiwebapp.eu).
